# Logistic Regression Visualization

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic logistic regression model using Python's `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries. The script calculates predicted probabilities for a dataset and visualizes the results.

## Features

- Implements a linear model (`model` function) and applies the sigmoid function (`sigmoid` function) for logistic regression.
- Visualizes the training data and the logistic regression prediction curve.

# Output
**Numerical Predictions: Displays the predicted probabilities for the training dataset.**
**Plot: A scatter plot of training data (red) and the logistic regression prediction curve (blue).**
